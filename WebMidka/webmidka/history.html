					<h5>Acient Times</h5>
					<p>The craft of barbering has been around for a very long time. It is believed that the oldest examples of razors that have survived to this day belong to the period of ancient Egyptian civilization. Of course, in those ancient times, such a separate profession did not exist, and the role of hairdressers was performed by priests and ancient healers.</p>

					<h5>First Barbershop</h5>
					<p>The very first barbershops, which at the same time were clubs for men, appeared in Ancient Greece. Men came to such salons to have their hair cut, curl their hair, cut their beards and, in parallel, conduct small talk. At that time, the profession of a hairdresser was held in high esteem. Unlike modern salons, visiting such establishments was a truly male occupation, while women styled their hair at home. During the reign of Alexander the Great, a decree was issued prohibiting soldiers from wearing beards, as rivals in battle, grabbing those by the beards, dragged them off their horses and killed them. </p>

					<h5>Middle Ages</h5>
					<p>Since the Middle Ages, many hairdressers had to perform other functions as well. During this period, the monks, who were at that time surgeons and dentists, were forbidden to perform bloodletting. Many hairdressers took the opportunity to help the monks by taking on forbidden duties. So in addition to cutting and shaving, they performed bloodletting, enemas, and tooth extractions.</p>

					<h5>The Rise Of Barbershops</h5>
					<p>However, with the increasing professionalism of surgery in 1745, surgeons separated from barbers. First in Britain, and then in France, barbers were banned from performing surgical procedures. Such a restriction led to the fact that already in the second half of the 18th century barbers lost their former status.</p>

					<h5>Richard le Barbour</h5>
					<p>In 1308, the oldest barber organization, the Honorable Union of Barbers, was founded in London, which still exists today. He headed the organization Richard le Barbour, who actually followed the entire hairdressing industry. At first, surgeons with little barbering experience joined the Barbers' Guild, but later created their own Guild of Surgeons.</p>

					<h5>Arthur Mohler</h5>
					<p>At the end of the 19th century, there were several notable developments in hairdressing that contributed to the growth of the profession. One such significant factor was the establishment by Arthur Mohler in 1893 of a school for barbers in Chicago. It was the first institution of its kind in the world. Branches of the school appeared in almost every city in the United States. At first, the school only taught courses in shaving, haircuts, and facial treatments, as the society was not ready to accept scientific treatments for hair, facial skin, and scalp.</p>
